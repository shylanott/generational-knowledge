  <p>Here are all the songs you just listened to, all top 3 hits and massively popular in their day.</p>

    <p>This song came out in <span class="compare-year">1998</span>. It’s been <span class="delta">30</span> years since its release and, to someone under 20, it’s as old as a song from <span class="baseline-year">1975</span> might seem to you. Even the most popular songs from history—The equivalent of “Hey Ya” in <span class="baseline-year">1975</span>—might have faded in the same way as Gettin Jiggy With it.

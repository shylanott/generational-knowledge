  <p class="big-text">Weâ€™re identifying songs unknown by younger generations.</p>
  <p>This is inspired by a YouTube trend where Gen Zâ€™ers film themselves listening to Queen, The Beatles, and Led Zepplin for, astonishingly, the first time.</p>
  <p>Weâ€™re quantifying generational gaps in music; your quiz answers power a dataset on how popular songs fade from culture.</p>
  <p>First, letâ€™s review the songs you just listened to, which all charted in the top 3 on the Billboardâ€™s Hot 100 and were massively popular in their day.</p>

  <p class="med-text">You were quizzed on <span class="total">10</span> Billboard top 3 hits from the <span class="song-decade">1970</span>s, and you knew <span class="know">50</span>% of them.

  <p>With your entry, we have data from <span class="total-entries">100</span> people; letâ€™s look at some gaps in cultural memory.</p>

  <p>This song came out in <span class="compare-year">1998</span>â€”itâ€™s as old to Gen Zâ€™ers as a song from <span class="baseline-year">1975</span> might seem to you. Still not convinced? Hereâ€™s a sample of top 3 hits from <span class="baseline-year">1975</span>...recognize any of them?</p>

  <p>I needed this mindset when I watched a recent TikTok trend, where teens dance to songs from the early 2000s, well before they were born. Is it really that surprising that Nickelback hasnâ€™t stood the test of time?</p>
